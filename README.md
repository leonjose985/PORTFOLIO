# Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following main folders:

* **INTERNSHIP (JINR):** Contains the code and related materials from my scientific internship at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR).
* **ML (YOUNG&YANDEX):** Includes assignments and solutions from the YOUNG&YANDEX intensive program, focusing on fundamental machine learning concepts.

## INTERNSHIP (JINR)

This folder contains the work I conducted during my scientific internship at JINR. Specifically, it includes:

* **GNN Model for PCQM4Mv2 Dataset:** The implementation of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model developed for the task of predicting quantum properties of organic molecules using the PCQM4Mv2 dataset.
* **ITTMM 2025 Scientific Article:** The scientific article I prepared for the ITTMM 2025 conference, detailing the methodology, results, and findings of my work on the molecular property prediction task.

This project demonstrates my ability to apply advanced deep learning techniques, specifically GNNs, to solve complex scientific problems and communicate research findings in a scientific publication format.

## ML (YOUNG&YANDEX)

This folder houses some of the tasks and my solutions from the YOUNG&YANDEX intensive program. The focus of these tasks was to understand the inner workings of various machine learning models and techniques, including:

* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Explorations and implementations related to understanding the architecture and functionality of CNNs.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Tasks aimed at grasping fundamental NLP concepts and model development.

While the tasks were provided by the organizers of the YOUNG&YANDEX intensive, the solutions required for the successful training and exploration of the models within these tasks were developed by me. This section highlights my proactive learning approach and my ability to implement and troubleshoot machine learning models across different domains.
